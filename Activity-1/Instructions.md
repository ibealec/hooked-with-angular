## Student Activity 1: Your Own Avengers
* Copy the `app` and `assets` folders from `Unsolved` and put it in place of your class project `app` folder.
* Run it with `ng serve` to make sure it works.
* In your terminal, *generate* two of your own heroes with any name you'd like. Include names, images, and give one of them a secret code name.
* Add some CSS to make the one with a secret codename different in some way.
* Refer to the instructor demo if you get lost.

* **BONUS**: Try to make the secret code name more discrete. If you have some time, try making the codename appear in the console when its respective hero is clicked on. Try Googling "Angular click" to see how you might do this.

* **REMEMBER**: The CLI has **MANY** awesome features that can be explored, but the main goal is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code the user has to write. 
* Bookmark their wiki for later exploration: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki Here's a link to the *generate* docs: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate
